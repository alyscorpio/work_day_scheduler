## Work Day Scheduler

## Description
For this project, I created a simple calendar application that allows users to save events for each hour of the day. I was given starter code, and asked to write JavaScript code that integrates Moment.js and the browser's local storage. 

While completing this project, I learned third party APIs, and local storage.
